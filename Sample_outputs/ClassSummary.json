{"ArrayList": "Resizable-array implementation of the List interface. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including null. Provides methods to manipulate the size of the array used internally to store the list. The size, isEmpty, get, set, iterator, and listIterator operations run in constant time. The add operation runs in amortized constant time. All other operations run in linear time. Each ArrayList instance has a capacity that grows automatically as elements are added. Not synchronized.", "Random": "Used to generate a stream of pseudorandom numbers. Uses a 48-bit seed and a linear congruential formula. Instances with the same seed and method calls will generate identical sequences of numbers. Not cryptographically secure. Threadsafe but may encounter contention in multithreaded designs.", "LocalDate": "Immutable date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system. Represents a date as year-month-day. Does not store or represent a time or time-zone. Value-based class; use equals method for comparisons. Immutable and thread-safe."}
