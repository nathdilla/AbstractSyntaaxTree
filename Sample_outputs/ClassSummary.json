{"ArrayList": "Resizable-array implementation of the List interface. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including null. Provides methods to manipulate the size of the array used internally to store the list. The size, isEmpty, get, set, iterator, and listIterator operations run in constant time. The add operation runs in amortized constant time. All other operations run in linear time. Each ArrayList instance has a capacity that grows automatically as elements are added.", "Random": "Used to generate a stream of pseudorandom numbers. Uses a 48-bit seed and a linear congruential formula. Instances are threadsafe but may encounter contention in multithreaded designs. Not cryptographically secure. Consider using SecureRandom for security-sensitive applications.", "LocalDate": "Immutable date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system. Represents a date as year-month-day. Other date fields like day-of-year, day-of-week, and week-of-year can be accessed. Does not store or represent a time or time-zone. Value-based class; avoid identity-sensitive operations. Immutable and thread-safe."}
