{"Scanner": "A simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions. The Scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern, which by default matches whitespace. It can convert tokens into values of different types using various next methods. The Scanner can read text from any object implementing the Readable interface and is capable of scanning numbers in standard formats as well as in the formats of the scanner's locale. The Scanner is not safe for multithreaded use without external synchronization."}
