  "ArrayList": "Resizable-array implementation of the List interface. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including null. Provides methods to manipulate the size of the array used internally to store the list. The size, isEmpty, get, set, iterator, and listIterator operations run in constant time. The add operation runs in amortized constant time. All other operations run in linear time. Each ArrayList instance has a capacity that grows automatically as elements are added. Not synchronized.",
  "Scanner": "A simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions. Breaks input into tokens using a delimiter pattern, which by default matches whitespace. Can read text from any object implementing the Readable interface. Not safe for multithreaded use without external synchronization.",
  "UUID": "Represents an immutable universally unique identifier (UUID). Represents a 128-bit value. Leach-Salz variant UUID layout. Version field describes the type of UUID. Four basic types: time-based, DCE security, name-based, and randomly generated UUIDs.",
  "Date": "Represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision. Deprecated methods for interpreting dates as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values. Use Calendar class for date and time fields and DateFormat class for formatting and parsing date strings. Date class may not reflect coordinated universal time (UTC) exactly."
